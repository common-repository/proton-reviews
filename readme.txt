The Proton Reviews plugin generates a custom link with a button that will take customers directly to these sites to leave their review. You can share the link easily with your customers through text, email, automated reply, and more!<strong>Proton Reviews Helps Filter Negative Reviews</strong>The Proton Reviews plugin also allows you to manage your online reputation. When a customer wants to leave a review for your business, our plugin filters those reviews by asking whether or not they would recommend your company. If not, their review will be sent to you in a private email so that you can resolve the matter away from Google and Yelp. This helps keep your online reputation healthy and improves customer experience.<h3>Official website</h3><a href="https://protonreviews.com/" target="_blank">https://protonreviews.com/</a>= Features: =1.
